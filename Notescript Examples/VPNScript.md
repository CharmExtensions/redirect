# VPN Enabling
````
[note]
- available = not used | not used = (*not-available*)
 ````
 this is the in-code variables, but made manually. Like in Javascript. "var available".
 
````
[randomize] 15 + h263, 36gd + [alphabet] | only if: "available"
- then: say [h1] = your "password" is: + 15 + [custom]
````
now, this is the passwors, and vpn function. to make it "pay to get vpn". the code is below.
````
when clicked (redirect) + "p=[pay]/link+replace[h%sf%]webhook=s?=|["paypal, ko-fi, or patreon']|if link: "true" then + get-user{@}-(https://"registered" + [?paypal, ko-fi, or patreon"].com "then pay" "clicked" price
or
when clicked (redirect) + "[payredirect]"
````
the top basically redirects you to the, "pay page" when clicked on the pay button. the bottom is the same thing just smaller.
